## üìÇ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-management.git
cd student-management
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file `src/environments/environment.ts` and add the following configuration:

```ts
export const environment = {
    apiUrl: "http://localhost:3000",
};
```

### 4. Generate Mock Database

You can generate a mock `db.json` file with a custom number of students using the Node script:

```bash
node generate-db.js 500
```

- `500` is the number of students to generate (you can replace it with any number you need).
- This will create/update db.json file.

### 5. Launch Mock Backend

Run the following command to start a JSON Server for your mock database:

```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```

### 6. Run the development server

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
